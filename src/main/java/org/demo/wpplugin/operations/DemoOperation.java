 * For any operation that is intended to be applied to the dimension in a particular location as indicated by the user

 *
 * <p>For more general kinds of operations you are free to subclass {@link AbstractOperation} instead, or even just
 * implement {@link Operation} directly.
 *
 * <p>There are also more specific base classes you can use:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link AbstractBrushOperation} - for operations that perform an action in the shape of the brush.
 *     <li>{@link AbstractPaintOperation} - for operations that apply the currently selected paint in the shape of the
 *     brush.
 * </ul>

 * <p><strong>Note</strong> that for now WorldPainter only supports operations that

     * @param centreX The x coordinate where the operation should be applied, in world coordinates.
     * @param centreY The y coordinate where the operation should be applied, in world coordinates.
     * @param inverse Whether to perform the "inverse" operation instead of the regular operation, if applicable. If the
     *                operation has no inverse it should just apply the normal operation.
     * @param first Whether this is the first tick of a continuous operation. For a one shot operation this will always
     *              be {@code true}.
     * @param dynamicLevel The dynamic level (from 0.0f to 1.0f inclusive) to apply in addition to the {@code level}
     *                     property, for instance due to a pressure sensitive stylus being used. In other words,

     *                     ignore this if it is not applicable. If the operation is being applied through a means which
     *                     doesn't provide a dynamic level (for instance the mouse), this will be <em>exactly</em>
