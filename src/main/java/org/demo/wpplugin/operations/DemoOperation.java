     *
     * @param centreX The x coordinate where the operation should be applied, in world coordinates.
     * @param centreY The y coordinate where the operation should be applied, in world coordinates.
     * @param inverse Whether to perform the "inverse" operation instead of the regular operation, if applicable. If the
     *                operation has no inverse it should just apply the normal operation.
     * @param first Whether this is the first tick of a continuous operation. For a one shot operation this will always
     *              be {@code true}.
     * @param dynamicLevel The dynamic level (from 0.0f to 1.0f inclusive) to apply in addition to the {@code level}
     *                     property, for instance due to a pressure sensitive stylus being used. In other words,
