/**
 * The exporter is responsible for applying the layer to the map when the world is being Exported by WorldPainter.
 *
 * <p>It must implement at least <em>one</em> of {@link FirstPassLayerExporter} or {@link SecondPassLayerExporter}.
 * Usually it only needs to implement one, although a complicated layer could conceivably need to perform operations at
 * both stages.
 *
 * <p>If can also optionally implement {@link IncidentalLayerExporter}, which is used to apply the layer incidentally
 * at one block location instead of an entire chunk or region. This is currently only used to apply layers to Custom
 * Cave Layer floors. If support for that is not necessary it can be left out.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Layer} by default finds the exporter by looking for a class in the {@code exporters} subpackage and
 * with the word {@code Exporter} appended to its own class name. In that case the exporter must have a default (public, no
 * arguments) constructor. You could also override the {@link Layer#getRenderer()} method if you want to do something
 * more complicated.
